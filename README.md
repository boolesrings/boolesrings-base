# mathblogging-base

A new base for mathblogging.org

Components

* feedscacher -- caches feeds locally
* feedmerger -- merging several feeds into one
* pagewriter -- writing out some markdown from a feed
* the markdown is then fed into a jekyll site, i.e., https://github.com/mathblogging/mathblogging.org
